# Overview
This release primarily provides support for Splunk v8.0.

## New Features
* Although the app itself has no new features, two features for the development of the app have been added. 
  * The first is the inclusion of an automated test framework using pytest and selenium. 
  * The second is the addition of Docker for running the app and the test bed. 
* A new setup view has been released using a JS enhanced XML view, deprecating the old Splunk `setup.xml`paradigm.

## Improvements
* All Python scripts are now cross-compatible with Python 2 and Python 3.

## Fixed Bugs
* The `Python Versions` dashboard will no longer show a successful build if it fails.
* Changed stanza name in `pyden.conf` for default configurations to `default-pys` due to `ConfigParser` standards.

## Known Bugs
There is a bug with the PyPI Hub `Install` button that, if clicked multiple times will keep producing additional status icons to the right of it. This is planned for correction through issue GL-9.

## Developmemt improvements
* Test bed execution occurs automatically and has been incorporated into the Gitlab pipeline.
